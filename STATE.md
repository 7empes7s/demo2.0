# STATE

Handoff file for long-running work. Newest first.

## 2026-10-05: Provenance v1

- Done: `modules/provenance` (`d2_provenance`, AGPL): deterministic `match/1` checker over a Docket snapshot (deposit dates, council vote tallies, numbers and dates in record text), HTTP API `POST /claims/grade` + `GET /checkers`, CLI, two seed labelled sets (60 claims, red precision 100%).
- Next: grow the labelled set to 500 claims on a live snapshot; a second checker (language model, quote-verified) publishing through the same schema; live link check for evidence URLs; wire Companion and Commons to the API.

## 2026-10-05: Docket Esch-sur-Alzette source

- Done: Docket snapshot/2 with Chamber and Esch sources (council points with votes, consultations); companion and citizen app read /1 and /2 and show Esch files.
- Next: fetch and extract Esch PDFs once there is a privacy rule for names in them; parse rapports analytiques and written questions.

## 2026-10-05: Phase 0, Record MVP

- Done: `modules/record` (log, checkpoints, proofs, HTTP API, CLI, OpenTimestamps), `modules/record-verify` (independent TypeScript verifier), `spec/record/` (format and vectors), 1M-entry benchmark.
- Next: first real anchor from Mulinux and its Bitcoin verification (Phase 0 acceptance), tiles, witnesses, signer roles in `spec/record-types.json`.

## 2026-10-05: Charter v0 and Scope

- Done: `charter/charter.yaml` 0.1.0 with schema, Luxembourg reference data, `d2_charter` (Python) and `@democracy2/charter` (TypeScript) passing shared vectors.
- Next: Rust binding; refresh populations from STATEC; decide the placeholders listed in the PR.

## 2026-10-05: overnight build, Phase 1 (Companion standalone)

- Done: repo pipeline (CI, merge gate, dev-setup, check, module boundary lint).
- Next: architecture docs, `spec/` schemas, Docket, Commons ranker, Provenance, Symmetry, citizen app.
- Waiting on Marouane: see the thread's bundled list.
